- Kevin said he spoke with Shana about delayed start which would be fine. What date range exactly is this referring to? Past Thanksgiving? December sometime?
- Is there any opportunity for tuition reimbursement if I were to go back to school for my PHD?
- Maybe in the mean time (before delayed start date) I could go through some of the on boarding and/or training to start getting up to speed?
- Is there any requirements on dress code or anything? (don't think so, but doesn't hurt to ask)
- What kind of opportunities are there for attending conferences/seminars on behalf of CFS? Are side projects and outside research encouraged?
- I'm still a little fuzzy on how the VC funded business world works. I would like to know more about it, and what the plan was for CFS for becoming profitable.
- What kind of hardware and software is used by the dev team? OSX/Windows, IDE(s), tools, etc... Is this (all or some) provided by CFS?
- I know that 401k is on the radar for early next year. What kind of match program is CFS thinking about for it's employee's? Any exact number? Or estimate?
- No company bonuses yet, is that something that will also be implemented in the near future as the company grows?
